This repository contains the code and data for the project "Adaptive Mobility Responses During Hurricanes Helene and Milton in 2024."

## Getting Started
To run the code, please ensure you have the required packages installed. Refer to the env.sh file for environment setup details.

### Data
Mobility Data:
Cleaned and compressed mobility data for the hurricanes can be downloaded from Figshare (https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Mobility_data_during_Hurricanes_Helene_and_Milton_in_2024/28365671). After downloading, place the files in the data/ directory.

### County Shapefile:
The shapefile for the study area (U.S. counties) can be downloaded from the U.S. Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2023&layergroup=Counties+%28and+equivalent%29).
Place the shapefiles in the data/county_geo/ directory.

### Outputs
Resulting figures are not included in the repository. You can generate all figures by running the analysis scripts.


## Media Coverage
